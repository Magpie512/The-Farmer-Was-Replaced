# The Farmer Was Replaced

The code in this repository is made by me and used in **[The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/)**

A collection of **Python** code snippets and modules for a surreal, "whack" farming game concept. This repository serves as a testing ground for core mechanics, unusual crop logic, and game state management.


## Project Overview

This repository contains the building blocks for a command-line farming simulator where the traditional rules of agriculture are deliberately broken. The focus is on implementing bizarre game features and ensuring the underlying Python logic is sound before integrating with a full game engine.
